# Architectural Decisions

This document captures the deliberate design choices that define the crate’s public API and internal architecture. Its purpose is not merely descriptive, but normative: it establishes constraints and clarifies trade-offs so that future evolution remains coherent. Contributors should be able to understand not only what was done, but why it was done that way, and what consequences follow from those decisions.

## Coordinates as Type-Level Semantic Objects

Coordinates are modeled as semantic types whose parameters encode three distinct dimensions: center (`C`), reference frame (`F`), and unit (`U`). These parameters are part of the type itself for both Cartesian and spherical representations.

The motivation is correctness by construction. Physically invalid operations, such as mixing incompatible centers, frames, or units, are prevented at compile time rather than deferred to runtime checks or informal conventions. Instead of relying on documentation or discipline, the type system enforces invariants directly.

The result is an API that is more strongly typed and sometimes more verbose. However, this explicitness is intentional. The compiler becomes an active participant in maintaining physical consistency, significantly reducing the risk of subtle misuse in downstream code.

## Parameterized Centers and Runtime Equality

Certain centers, such as `Topocentric` (via `ObserverSite`) and `Bodycentric` (via `BodycentricParams`), cannot be fully expressed at the type level without causing an impractical explosion of distinct types. While the *kind* of center is encoded statically, the specific parameters associated with a given instance are validated at runtime.

This hybrid approach reflects a practical constraint. Encoding each possible observer site or body configuration as a unique type would be theoretically pure but operationally untenable. Instead, the design enforces structural correctness at compile time and parameter equality at runtime.

The consequence is that mismatches can trigger panics in default operations. For code that requires graceful failure semantics, fallible variants are provided. This keeps high-level usage ergonomic while preserving strict validation options for library or infrastructure code.

## Physically Meaningful Separation of Transforms

Transformations are separated according to their physical meaning rather than bundled under a single abstraction. Frame rotations are implemented as pure rotation matrices. Center shifts are modeled as affine translations. Observation effects, such as aberration or apparent place corrections, are treated as a distinct processing pipeline.

Each of these operations carries different invariants and requires different contextual inputs. For example, horizontal transformations depend on an observer site and Earth orientation parameters such as UT1 and polar motion. By keeping these domains distinct, the API makes such dependencies explicit rather than implicit.

This design avoids hidden assumptions, particularly regarding Earth orientation and observational context. The user is required to supply the appropriate information where necessary, reinforcing clarity over convenience.

## Modular Provider Registry with Explicit Hubs

The provider layer is organized as a small module tree under `coordinates::transform::providers` rather than a single registry file. Inertial frames, Earth-orientation frames, catalog frames, TEME support, planetary body-fixed frames, and center-shift families each live in their own submodule.

This structure is deliberate. New extensions should add only the direct primitives for their domain and then compose through the established hubs:

- Frame rotations compose through `ICRS`.
- Center shifts compose through `Barycentric`.

Shared helper functions implement common patterns such as inversion, two-step composition, antisymmetric center shifts, and frame-aware rotation of ephemeris vectors. This keeps implementations local, reduces duplicate arithmetic, and makes debugging easier because related providers are grouped together.

The consequence is that adding a new frame or center should typically require changes in one focused module plus tests, rather than editing a monolithic provider file with unrelated logic.

## Explicit, Context-Driven Earth Orientation

High-precision topocentric and horizontal calculations depend on Earth orientation parameters. To accommodate this, the crate introduces `AstroContext`, which encapsulates EOP providers such as `IersEop` or `NullEop`.

The design principle is that precision should be an explicit choice. `IersEop` uses the active/bundled EOP data owned by `tempoch` and rejects epochs outside coverage; `NullEop` is the explicit zero-EOP approximation for applications that intentionally trade fidelity for simplicity. EOP tables are keyed by UTC/MJD, so TT epochs are converted before lookup.

Convenience paths exist for common scenarios, but context-aware `_with_ctx` variants are available for full control. This dual-layer approach keeps typical workflows straightforward while preserving the ability to perform rigorous, high-precision computations.

## Pluggable Ephemeris Backends

Ephemeris computation is abstracted behind an `Ephemeris` trait. An analytical backend based on VSOP87 and ELP2000 is always available, ensuring a lightweight baseline. More precise JPL DE4xx backends, such as DE440 or DE441, are available behind feature flags.

This design reflects the diversity of use cases. Many applications do not require the mass and precision of DE4xx datasets, and including them by default would unnecessarily increase build size and complexity. Feature gating allows users to opt into heavier datasets only when needed.

At compile time, `DefaultEphemeris` selects the best available backend based on enabled features. This preserves a clean API surface while allowing build-time configurability.

## Build-Time Dataset Generation and Embedding

Datasets including VSOP87, ELP2000, and optionally DE4xx are generated and embedded at build time. Earth-orientation data is consumed from `tempoch`, which owns the active IERS bundle. This eliminates runtime data dependencies for the default path and ensures deterministic behavior once the crates are compiled.

The advantage is twofold. First, runtime performance is improved because all required data is locally embedded. Second, operational environments remain simpler because no external data loading is required after build.

When JPL features are enabled, builds may download large datasets. To support fast or offline development workflows, the `SIDERUST_JPL_STUB` option provides a lightweight alternative for iteration.

## Object vs. Coordinate Sample Separation (Trackable)

The crate distinguishes between two fundamentally different concepts: an **astronomical object** that can produce coordinates at any time, and a **coordinate sample** that records a specific position at a specific instant.

Previously, both roles were conflated in a single `Target<T>` type. This created a semantic mismatch: a `Target` sounded like an object you observe, but it was actually a timestamped coordinate snapshot. Functions that needed "anything that can give me a position at time t" had no trait to express that requirement, leading to ad-hoc dispatch and limiting generic composition.

The resolution introduces two separate abstractions:

- **`CoordinateWithPM<T>`** (formerly `Target<T>`): a concrete struct representing a single position sample with an optional proper-motion correction. It does not "know" how to compute positions at arbitrary times; it simply stores one. A backward-compatible `Target<T>` type alias is provided.

- **`Trackable`**: a trait representing anything that can produce coordinates at a given Julian Date. It is implemented for solar-system unit types (via VSOP87/ELP2000), `Star` (via catalog coordinates), `direction::ICRS` (identity, fixed directions are time-invariant), and `CoordinateWithPM<T>` itself (returns the stored position).

This separation enables generic programming over trackable objects. A function constrained by `T: Trackable` can accept a planet, a star, a fixed sky direction, or a precomputed coordinate sample without knowing the concrete type. The `AltitudePeriodsProvider` and `AzimuthProvider` traits remain independent dispatch layers for observation-specific calculations.

The design consequence is that adding new trackable object types (e.g., comets, satellites, asteroids with orbital propagation) requires only implementing `Trackable`, without modifying existing infrastructure.

## Safety-First Policy

The crate intentionally avoids `unsafe` blocks in its primary implementation. Given the numerical intensity of the domain, undefined behavior would be particularly difficult to detect and potentially catastrophic in its consequences.

Performance considerations are addressed through algorithmic improvements, careful use of safe Rust abstractions, and feature-gated dependencies rather than by relaxing safety guarantees. This policy reflects a prioritization of correctness, maintainability, and long-term reliability over marginal gains from low-level optimizations.
